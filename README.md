# AgriRoute â€“ Optimized Multi-Stage Agricultural Supply Chain Design

## Overview

Agriculture supply chains involve various stages from farm to distribution, often constrained by perishability, transport limitations, and the need for cost minimization. In many cases, inefficiencies in routing, resource allocation, and scheduling lead to higher operational costs and spoilage. The challenge is to design an optimized multi-stage supply chain algorithm that minimizes cost while meeting dynamic requirements such as perishability, limited capacity, and traffic disruptions. The goal is to create a scalable and robust algorithm that optimizes both routing and resource allocation, ensuring efficient delivery with minimal spoilage.
